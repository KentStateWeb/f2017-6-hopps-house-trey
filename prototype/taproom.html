            <h3>Growler Care</h3>
            <p>Keep your beer cold and once the cap is removed, it's best to enjoy the beer within the next several hours. Rinse-out the growler as soon as practical. When you have time, soak in hot soapy water for a few minutes and use a brush to wash or shake vigorously. Drain and rinse out a couple of times. Turn the growler upside down to drain. Dry and store with the cap off. If your growler does not pass the quality control check (nose-check) when you bring it in, we'll wash it on the spot to ensure the quality of your beer.</p>

        <h2>Currently on Tap</h2>
          <h3>Frogtown IPA</h3>
          <p>It took the brewmaster from Frogtown, OH (aka Cassella) a 12 year trek to the west coast to come up with this recipe - Frogtown IPA, It's Hoppy! <br>
          6.1% ABV | 7 SRM Color | 45 IBU</p>

          <h3>Moweizen</h3>

          <h3>Wally Post RED</h3>
          <p>Summer, baseball and beer! This American Red is brewed to have a complex malt backbone with a subtle rye spiciness to celebrate a local legend. Play ball!<br>

          <h3>Honeywagon IPA</h3>
          <p>It's no load of manure - the aromatics of this Honeywagon has an eye-opening tropical mango-pineapple fruitiness. Honey malt sweetness provides enough body to accompany big hop flavors making this a refreshing American IPA. Cheers!<br>

          <h3>Marzen Oktoberfest</h3>
          <p>***On Tap September 14th*** Celebrate the fall season with our traditional Marzen Oktoberfest.

Prost!<br>

          <h3>Black Bridge Smoked Porter</h3>
          <p>A little smokey! Takes us back to that childhood spot underneath the Black Bridge on the banks of the Chickasaw. Enjoy its beechwood smoky aroma and flavors on top of a roasty malt body, finishing chocolaty bitter, then sweet. Delicious!

          <h3>Buzzards Glory</h3>

          <h3>Little Turtle IPA</h3>
          <p>This seasonal wet-hopped American IPA features Cascade hops from Heartland Hops in Ft. Recovery, OH. Whole wet hop cones late in the boiling brew kettle and dry-hopped in the fermenter bring out piney and citrus aromas and flavors, balancing a biscuit malt flavor.<br>

          <h3>Blackberry Prairie Wheat</h3>
          <p>With blackberries from Cranberry Prairie, our Blackberry Prairie Wheat has a purple hue tint to a pillowy white head with a hint of blackberry fruitiness on the nose and finish. In between is a refreshing medium-bodied American Wheat Ale that can make one fall in love with beer, all over again. Take a hearty drink and enjoy!<br>
          5.8% ABV | 11 SRM Color | 19 IBU</p>

          <h3>Burbank Blonde</h3>
          <p>This Blonde inspired me to take the leap into Craft Beer. Balancing simple country malt with Great Northwest Valley floral hops is what makes this beer so special. Enjoy!<br>
          4.8 ABV | 3 SRM Color | 20 IBU</p>

          <h3>Baked Oatmeal Stout</h3>
          <p>A chocolate &amp; coffee roasted grain flavor upfront accompanies a nutty, slightly sweet, and creamy finish. We toast the oats so you can raise your glass - Cheers!<br>
