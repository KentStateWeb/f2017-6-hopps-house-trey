        <h2>By the taster, by the pint, by the growler...</h2>
        <p>Visit our tap room and see what’s on tap! Enjoy a fresh beer by the pint or a sampler glass. After you’ve decided which is your favorite beer, bring home a growler!</p>
        <p>See what we have on tap and bring a half-gallon growler of beer home to enjoy. Bring in your growler for a re-fill, or buy a new one for $6.</p>
        <div class="care">
          <p>GROWLER CARE: Keep your beer cold and once the cap is removed, it's best to enjoy the beer within the next several hours. Rinse-out the growler as soon as practical. When you have time, soak in hot soapy water for a few minutes and use a brush to wash or shake vigorously. Drain and rinse out a couple of times. Turn the growler upside down to drain. Dry and store with the cap off. If your growler does not pass the quality control check (nose-check) when you bring it in, we'll wash it on the spot to ensure the quality of your beer.</p>

          <h3>Frogtown IPA</h3>

          <h3>Wally Post RED</h3>

          <h3>Honeywagon IPA</h3>
          <p>It's no load of manure - the aromatics of this Honeywagon has an eye-opening tropical mango-pineapple fruitiness. Honey malt sweetness provides enough body to accompany big hop flavors making this a refreshing American IPA. Cheers!<br>

          <h3>Marzen Oktoberfest</h3>

          <h3>Black Bridge Smoked Porter</h3>
          <p>A little smokey! Takes us back to that childhood spot underneath the Black Bridge on the banks of the Chickasaw. Enjoy its beechwood smoky aroma and flavors on top of a roasty malt body, finishing chocolaty bitter, then sweet. Delicious!

          <h3>Little Turtle IPA</h3>
          <p>This seasonal wet-hopped American IPA features Cascade hops from Heartland Hops in Ft. Recovery, OH. Whole wet hop cones late in the boiling brew kettle and dry-hopped in the fermenter bring out piney and citrus aromas and flavors, balancing a biscuit malt flavor.<br>

          <h3>Blackberry Prairie Wheat</h3>
          <p>With blackberries from Cranberry Prairie, our Blackberry Prairie Wheat has a purple hue tint to a pillowy white head with a hint of blackberry fruitiness on the nose and finish. In between is a refreshing medium-bodied American Wheat Ale that can make one fall in love with beer, all over again. Take a hearty drink and enjoy!<br>
          5.8% ABV | 11 SRM Color | 19 IBU</p>

          <h3>Burbank Blonde</h3>

          <h3>Baked Oatmeal Stout</h3>
